  <h2>Questions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>You have been given the task to manage a small library&#39;s book inventory. The library has a collection of
      books, and each book is represented as an object with the following properties:
      title (string): The title of the book.
      author (string): The author of the book.
      yearPublished (number): The year the book was published.
      available (boolean): Whether the book is currently available for borrowing.
      The library&#39;s book inventory is stored in an array named library. <br>
      Create the library Array:
      Start by creating an empty array named library to store book objects.
      Add Books to the Library: <br>
      Add the following book objects to the library array using the push method:
      &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, &quot;F. Scott Fitzgerald&quot;, 1925, true
      &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, &quot;Harper Lee&quot;, 1960, true
      &quot;1984&quot;, &quot;George Orwell&quot;, 1949, false
      &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, &quot;Jane Austen&quot;, 1813, true
      </li>

      <li>
        Update the Availability of a Book:
        You need to update the availability of &quot;1984&quot; to true by directly modifying the available property in the
        library array.
        Remove a Book from the Library:
        Remove &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; from the library array using the splice method.
      </li>

      <li>

        Check if a Book is in the Library: <br>

        Check if &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is in the library using the includes method. Note that this method cannot be
        directly applied to objects, so think creatively about how to solve this.
      </li>

      <li>
        Borrow the First Book: <br>
        Assume a user wants to borrow the first available book. Remove the first book from the library array
        using the shift method. Update its available status to false before removing it from the array, and then
        display the updated book details.
        Add a New Book to the Start of the Library:
        Add a new book &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, &quot;J.D. Salinger&quot;, 1951, true to the beginning of the library array
        using the unshift method.
      </li>
      
      <li>
        Get a List of All Book Titles:
        Extract a list of all the book titles from the library array and combine them into a single string, with each
        title separated by a comma, using the join method.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a New Library Section:
        Create a new array called newArrivals containing only the last two books in the library array using the
        slice method.
      </li>
